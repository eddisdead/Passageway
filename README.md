# Passageway
My Unreal project for Passageway BA2a

This a project started for my 2nd Year in Norwich University of the Arts. I am creating a 3D environment that represents the physical space that the artist M.C.Escher worked from including a an abstract representation of his creative inspiration in the form of a passageway.
